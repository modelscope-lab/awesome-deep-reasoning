## Datasets
* [NuminaMath-TIR](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/AI-MO/NuminaMath-TIR) - Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) plays a crucial role in this competition.  
* [NuminaMath-CoT](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/AI-MO/NuminaMath-CoT) - Approximately 860k math problems, where each solution is formatted in a Chain of Thought (CoT) manner.


## Evaluation
